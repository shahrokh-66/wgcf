## Usage
Run `wgcf` in a terminal without any arguments to display the help screen, all commands and parameters are documented.

### Register new account
Run the following command in a terminal:
```bash
wgcf register
```
The new account will be saved under `wgcf-account.toml`

### Generate WireGuard profile
[Register an account](#register-new-account) if you haven't already. Then, run:
```
wgcf generate
```
The WireGuard profile will be saved under `wgcf-profile.conf`

### Change license key
If you have an existing account with Warp+, for an example on your phone, you can apply its license key to the account generated by this tool and share your Warp+ status. Please note that there is a maximum limit of 5 active linked devices at a time. 

First, get your Warp+ account license key. To see the license key on Android:
1. Open the `1.1.1.1` app
2. Click on the hamburger menu button on the top-right corner
3. Navigate to: `Account` > `Key`

[Register an account](#register-new-account) if you haven't already. Finally, edit `wgcf-account.toml` directly with the new license key and run the `update` command:
```bash
wgcf update
```
or use an environment variable:
```bash
WGCF_LICENSE_KEY="123412341234" wgcf update
```
Your account will be updated remotely, and no further changes are necessary.

### Check device status
Run the following command in a terminal:
```
wgcf status
```

### Verify Warp/Warp+ works
Connect to the WireGuard profile generated by this tool, then run:
```bash
wgcf trace
```
If you look at the last line, it should say `warp=on` or `warp=plus`, depending on whether you have Warp or Warp+ respectively.
